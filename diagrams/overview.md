# Project: DSA Gamify - Gamified DSA Learning Platform

## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To create an engaging and effective platform for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by transforming the learning process into a gamified, interactive experience.

**Mission:** To build a scalable web application that tracks user progress, provides AI-generated challenges, and fosters a sense of accomplishment, moving beyond simple rote memorization to genuine problem-solving skills. The initial user is a single developer, but the architecture must support future growth.

## 2. Core Features (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product will focus on delivering the core learning loop.

* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login for progress tracking.
* **Topic Selection:** Users can select a DSA category (e.g., "Dynamic Programming", "Graphs", "Arrays").
* **AI-Powered Problem Generation:**
    * **Manual Trigger:** A user can click a "Generate Problem" button within a category to receive a new DSA problem and its solution, generated by a backend LLM.
    * **Daily Challenge:** One unique problem is automatically generated each day and presented to the user.
* **Interactive IDE (Placeholder):** A simple code editor (e.g., using Monaco Editor) where users can attempt to solve the problem. Code execution is not part of the MVP.
* **Progress Tracking:** The system will track which problems a user has attempted and marked as "solved."
* **Gamification (Minimal):**
    * **XP Points:** Users gain Experience Points (XP) for solving a problem.
    * **Leveling System:** A basic leveling system based on total XP.
* **Modern Frontend:** A clean, modern interface with drag-and-drop elements for future features and a simple toggle for dark/light mode.

## 3. Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** **Next.js (React)** with TypeScript.
    * **UI/Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a component library like **Shadcn/ui** for modern, themeable components.
    * **State Management:** Zustand or React Query for managing server state.

* **Backend:** **FastAPI (Python)**
    * **LLM Integration:** `LangChain` or `Haystack` library to manage prompting and interaction with a foundational LLM (e.g., a Llama variant).
    * **WebSockets:** For potential real-time features post-MVP.

* **Database:** **PostgreSQL**
    * **ORM:** SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations (in the FastAPI service).

* **Identity & Auth:** **Keycloak**
    * **Reasoning:** A powerful, open-source Identity and Access Management solution. It can be self-hosted in Docker, handles user registration, login, and social logins out-of-the-box, and secures APIs using JWTs. It's more robust than a self-implemented solution.

* **Monitoring & Observability:**
    * **Metrics:** **Prometheus** (for collecting time-series data from services).
    * **Dashboards:** **Grafana** (for visualizing metrics from Prometheus).

* **Containerization & Orchestration:** **Docker Compose**
    * Manages all services for a consistent local development environment.
